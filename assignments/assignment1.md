# Domains
The following shows ten domains (general problem areas) that I am interested in, including seven unselected and three selected domains.

Seven unselected domains:
1. **Tennis:** Practicing tennis with my coach and friends regularly, competing in local amateur matches, and enjoying exploring new tennis accessories like racquets or shoes.

2. **Limited sneakers and collectable toys:** Following new sneaker and toy releases, collecting limited editions with high price potential, and tracking value change over time.

3. **Pet care and wellness:** Feeding, walking, and monitoring daily digestion, sleep, mood, and health of my pets.

4. **Dining and food exploration:** Trying new restaurants, cuisines, and food trends in the cities I live in.

5. **Coffee, energy drinks, boba:** Drinking them daily to keep myself energized or bring myself a happy mood. However, worrying about over-consumption of caffeine or sugar.

6. **Video games and e-sports:** Playing MOBA games with friends at leisure. Watching competitive e-sports games to support my favorite teams and to learn strategies. Also hoping to avoid addiction during busy school days.

7. **Travel and city exploration:** Discovering unique and cool local spots (which is called “citywalk-ing”) and visiting different countries to explore diverse landscapes and cultures. 

And the followings are the three domains I select:

8. **Health (workout and diet):** I began paying closer attention to my overall health and physical strength. I now go to the gym at least three times a week and follow a stricter diet, avoiding foods that trigger food sensitivity reactions. To stay consistent, I use multiple apps to track calories burned, workouts completed, and meals consumed each day. Yet, I still face persistent uncertainties: Why does my body react differently from day to day? Should I adjust my food intake depending on how I feel? Which foods truly support my health? And does my workout routine actually align with my long-term goals?

9. **Online shopping:** I have been an active online shopper for years, with an Amazon Prime membership and regular use of platforms like Best Buy for electronics, eBay for secondhand, rare items, StockX for sneakers, Amazon for everyday goods, and brand websites. While I enjoy browsing for cool products and comparing deals, the shopping experience can be fragmented — finding products I need, switching between multiple platforms to find the best price, keeping track of things I already bought, viewing delivery status, and verifying product authenticity. This domain interests me because it allows me to boost the experience of something that a lot of people and I do almost daily.

10. **Productivity, scheduling, and planning:** I have the habit of planning out my routine ahead of time and track progress daily to (hopefully) enhance productivity. I spend a lot of time experimenting with productivity tools like Notion, calendar apps, and Trello. Although many of these apps are powerful, I often find them overly complex and not tailored to my personal routine. Since I use several apps concurrently, I often spend over an hour each day updating schedules and tracking progress, making me feel inefficient about my daily workflow. During several conversations with friends who also use these productivity tools, we often wonder: Is there a simpler and more elegant solution for productivity management?

# Problems
I identified three problem for each of the three selected domains above and highlighted the three problems worth pursuing (marked as ✅).

## Online shopping
### Impulse purchases and inconvenient expense tracking (✅)
When shopping online, I often make impulse purchases like small accessories, flashy on-sale items, or “suggested for you” products that I did not even plan for. While I eventually realized that these purchases are not necessary, there is no quick way to reflect on or log them at the moment of purchase. I wasn’t able to rationally distinguish whether I “need” or “want” something. Also, most expense-tracking apps require complicated manual input, so I often forget or avoid recording my spending. Consequently, my monthly spending feels less transparent, and I lose track of how much I’m actually spending, making me unaware of the impulse purchases I have made.

I selected this problem because impulse shopping is something many shoppers experience regularly. Online platforms are designed to encourage quick purchases through flash sales and recommendations, which makes it difficult to pause and reflect on whether I actually need the item. I believe this problem has demand because financial awareness and budgeting are important to people who shop frequently online. The problem also doesn’t seem to require solutions that are overambitious or require critical mass.

### Difficulty in finding the best deal across platforms or over time
When shopping online — whether for electronics, sneakers, or everyday items — I often worry I’m overpaying or missing a better deal elsewhere. Checking multiple sites or tracking prices manually is time-consuming, and I sometimes regret buying too soon when the same product appears cheaper later. This uncertainty makes online shopping stressful.

Although this frustration is common, established tools like Honey and CamelCamelCamel already (partly) address it. Creating a solution that meaningfully improves on these products would be challenging and risks lacking differentiation.

### Complexity in tracking package delivery across platforms
Shopping on sites like Amazon, eBay, StockX, and brand stores leaves me juggling multiple tracking numbers across emails and apps. Checking delivery status often means digging through messages, logging into accounts, or switching between delivery apps, which is time-consuming and prone to missed updates. I often wish there were a single, unified view of all my deliveries.

The challenge is user indifference: while this problem is a real pain point, many people may not pay for a solution when they can manage by spending extra time (such as tracking delivery status in emails). Building such a product is also technically difficult, since not all e-commerce platforms offer APIs, and scraping delivery data could raise privacy concerns.




## Health (workout and diet)

### Food sensitivities and body reactions (✅)
Even though I log calories and meals, my body often feels different from day to day — sometimes energized, sometimes sluggish, sometimes with digestive discomfort. Many of my friends report similar issues, including constipation, bloating, or drowsiness caused by the food they eat. These issues are frustrating as they affect productivity and mood, but are also too minor to bring to a doctor. While food sensitivity tests exist, they aren’t widely trusted in the medical field and are often expensive. This leaves me and others with little guidance on what foods may actually be affecting my body. I wish there were a way to better connect what I eat to how I feel so that I could make smarter food choices.

I select this problem because food sensitivities represent a genuine issue with authentic demand. The problem does not require complex scientific breakthroughs to address; instead, a practical solution can be built around logging and visualizing the connection between diet and health outcomes. When I discussed food sensitivity with friends, many said they were affected by this problem. One friend noted, “We shouldn’t feel embarrassed about dealing with constipation or diarrhea. Those things happen to everyone. But we should really understand what food is the cause of the issues.” A solution to this problem could help many people who are troubled by these everyday health “glitches” better understand their own bodies and food sensitivities. Compared with other health-related problems (mentioned below), a solution to this problem carries fewer risks of “unexpected consequences” since it is grounded in users’ own logging of diet and symptom patterns.

### Uncertainty about which workout routine matches health goals
At the gym, I try to balance strength training, cardio, and stretching, but I’m often unsure whether my routine truly aligns with my health goals or body type. Most fitness apps track activity and calories but rarely adapt to individual needs. I frequently wonder: am I overtraining, undertraining, or simply doing the wrong kind of exercise? Clearer, personalized feedback would make a big difference.

However, building a solution to this problem would require deeper research in sports medicine and health science, in addition to coding the software. It also carries potential risks, such as recommending inappropriate exercises that could harm users.

### Recovery after workouts, irregular schedules, and stress
I often struggle with recovery, as soreness, fatigue, and stress don’t always improve with rest. Irregular eating and sleep habits make things worse, and I’m unsure whether to prioritize nutrition, sleep, or stress management. While many apps track workouts or sleep individually, few connect these factors to show how they interact and impact recovery. Without better guidance, it’s difficult to optimize my health.

However, this problem involves too many variables — nutrition, sleep, stress, etc. — making it hard to isolate solutions through a simple software app. It also carries risks, since incorrect guidance could hinder rather than support recovery.

## Productivity, scheduling, and planning

### Over-ambitious scheduling that does not match reality (✅)
When I plan my daily routines, I often create highly detailed schedules packed with ambitious goals. However, in practice, unexpected events, procrastination, or shifting priorities disrupt my schedule. By the end of the day, my calendar could look completely different from what actually happened. This mismatch leaves me feeling guilty or unproductive the next morning, even though I usually did complete meaningful work—just not the exact tasks I had originally scheduled. I wish scheduling tools were more flexible and forgiving, offering support that adapts to what actually happens and helping me learn how to optimize future plans.

I chose this problem because it reflects one of the most frustrating parts of my daily routine. I believe there is an authentic demand, since most existing productivity tools cannot quickly and easily adjust to real-time changes in schedules. These tools leave users stuck with rigid plans that do not reflect the realities of their lives. Most apps emphasize “sticking to the plan” instead of helping users adapt to changes gracefully. The framing of this problem requires no critical mass and is not overambitious. By addressing it, I could create something genuinely useful for many people, including myself.

### Time-consuming daily tasks planning and tracking
I spend a significant amount of time updating information stored in productivity tools to manage my schedule, tasks, progress, and expenses. Most productivity apps require entering so much information that by the time I finish logging, it feels like I’ve spent as much energy organizing my day as I have doing the actual work. While I value being organized, the work it takes to constantly update information is tiring and inefficient. A faster, less repetitive way to log and track routines would make planning feel like support rather than extra work.

The solution to this problem would require ambitious technological innovation, as it involves redefining the way productivity apps function. It would demand creating a new software that operates more efficiently and intuitively than established tools like Notion. Therefore, I didn’t select this problem.

### Too many disconnected apps
My productivity setup is split across multiple platforms—Notion for notes, Trello for projects, Google Calendar for scheduling, and more. Each tool works well in its own domain, but they don’t integrate smoothly. I end up duplicating information, forgetting updates, or feeling overwhelmed and losing track of tasks. Switching between so many apps just to stay organized feels inefficient. A unified system that integrates core features would be beneficial.

However, this problem risks the founder’s fallacy, since many people already commit to only one single platform like Notion or Google Workspace. Building a solution would also be technically challenging, requiring numerous API integrations—and some platforms may not even provide public APIs, creating significant obstacles.

# Stakeholders

## Online Shopping
1. Shopper (direct user): They are people like me who make impulse purchases online. They are impacted because they feel regret or stress about overspending, and a lack of transparent access to spending records makes the problem even worse for them.

2. Families (indirect users): People who share the Shopper’s finances or living expenses. They may also be affected when overspending leads to tighter budgets or financial conflicts. For instance, parents cut the living expenses they give to their children if their children overspend frequently.

3. Retail platforms (non-users): Online platforms like Amazon and eBay. They benefit from impulse purchases. Any solution that encourages reflection before buying could negatively impact their sales.

## Health (workout and diet)
1. Food-sensitive individuals (direct users): These are people who regularly experience issues such as constipation, bloating, or fatigue triggered by the foods they eat. Because they are often unaware of their specific sensitivities, they struggle to identify which foods are linked to their symptoms. As a result, they are directly affected by ongoing confusion, discomfort, and uncertainty about their diet.

2. Healthcare professionals (“indirect users”): Doctors and dietitians whom food-sensitive individuals may consult when their symptoms persist. A well-designed solution could support these professionals by providing structured logs and context, making it easier to understand the patient’s dietary patterns and potential triggers.

3. Friends and family (non-users): People who share meals, live together, or socialize with the food-sensitive individuals. They are indirectly impacted when the food-sensitive individuals struggle with food sensitivities. For example, they would need to avoid certain restaurants, change shared meal plans, or be affected by the food-sensitive individual’s low energy or discomfort during activities.

## Productivity, scheduling, and planning
1. Productivist (direct users): Mostly students and professionals who hope to boost daily productivity through planning and scheduling. They are the primary audience, often overloading schedules and feeling frustrated when plans fail.

2. Peers, teammates, or coworkers (users or non-users): People who are involved in the Productivist’s plans or schedules. When the Productivists’ planning causes missed deadlines or rescheduling, others in their circle are also impacted, causing them to also reschedule to accommodate new changes.

3. Productivity tool developers (non-users): ​​These are companies that create productivity and scheduling apps such as Notion or Google Calendar. Recognizing and addressing this problem could give them valuable insights into designing more adaptive, user-centered tools. However, a highly effective solution may also draw users away from their existing platforms, potentially reducing engagement with their current products.

# About Me
Hello visitors! My name is Fuqi Cui. I love to code cool websites. Check my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Avril-Cui) to see projects I have been working on.

Besides coding, here are some other things I enjoy doing:
1. Playing tennis
2. Video games
3. Collect sneakers

I really look forward to 6.1040, and hope to build some cool projects during this class (yay!)
